```


## Welcome

- this session is aimed at Excel beginners
- it's social and practical, so **cameras on** please
- while we're waiting to start, you might like to:
  - join our Teams channel: **[tinyurl.com/kindnetwork](https://forms.office.com/r/WQdd6HSCEW)**
  - look at our training pages: **[tinyurl.com/kindtrp](https://nes-dew.github.io/KIND-training/)**
  - look at [the M365 Skills Hub](https://scottish.sharepoint.com/sites/NHSSLearningPathways)

## Where does this fit in?

![KIND Excel beginner skill tree](images/clipboard-3911010684.png)

-   for this session, you'll need to be familiar with the Excel basics (getting around in Excel, opening/saving/closing files, and a little bit of A1 referencing)
-   we're going to dodge formatting and formulas as much as possible today

## Session outline

- a word of warning
- understanding tidy data
- a practical introduction to making tidy data
- text to columns
- transposing

## A word of warning

-   tidying data can be very slow and complicated
-   in Excel, there are lots of advanced tools that can speed things up
    -   PowerQuery especially
-   this is a beginner's session, so we'll avoid the more fancy tools
-   **but** if your process takes lots of manual work, it's definitely worth exploring alternative ways of working

## Tidy data 

```{r}
tibble(date = c("2025-01-01", "2025-01-02", "2025-01-03"),
       service_a = c(99,77,55),
       service_b = c(11,33,55)) |>
  knitr::kable()
```

. . .

* one value per cell
* each column contains all the values of one measurement
* each row shows all the values for one date

## Entering values

-   imagine that we want to measure something across several years: `2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022`?
-   practical:
    -   open Excel
    -   start a new workbook
    -   add a column header `year` in cell `A1`
    -   then add each of those five values in the five cells underneath (down to `A6`)

## More values

-   we're going to be using some [birthrate data from the NRS](https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/publications/births-time-series-data/) for this session. We'll start by adding some birth rate data

-   this is given as births per 1,000 women in five year age brackets. We'll start with 25-29 year old mothers

-   please add the header `25-29yrs` in cell `B1`

-   here are the values for our five years: `73.4, 71, 66.8, 69.6, 66.7`

## Another column

| 30-34yrs |
|----------|
| 90.9     |
| 88.6     |
| 83.4     |
| 85.9     |
| 84.4     |

-   please could you add some new data to your table showing births for another age group

## Back to tidy data

-   we've now got some data with:
    -   each value in a cell
    -   each variable in a column
        -   here, this is a maternal age bracket
    -   each observation in a row
        -   here, this is a year


## Fixing several values per cell

-   We often find useful data with more than one value per cell
-   this can be helpful for humans </br> ![multiple values is good for humans, but bad for Excel](images/clipboard-1363924537.png)
-   Excel can't do anything with this data

## Exercise: many values per cell

| 35-39	    |
|-----------|
| 54.2 (21%)|
| 52.7 (20%)|
| 49.4 (19%)|
| 52.8 (20%)|
| 52	(20%) |

- please add this column of data to your table
- does it look similar to your existing data?


## What's the solution?

-   make this data have **one value per cell**
-   we could remove all the percentages by hand
-   `Text to Columns` gives us a better tool for the job </br> ![Text to Columns gives us a better tool for the job](images/clipboard-3594403318.png)

## Text to Columns

-   select a column
-   in the `Data` tab of the ribbon, you should find the `Text to Columns` tool </br> ![Text to Columns tool](images/clipboard-3002655192.png)
-   note that you can keep, or remove, the percentage column. We'll **skip** it, to keep things simple </br> ![keep, or remove, the percentage column](images/clipboard-4061284093.png)


## Exercise: transposed data

| Bracket | 2018| 2019| 2020| 2021| 2022|
|---------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| 25-29yrs|73.4 |71.0	|66.8	|69.6	|66.7 |
| 30-34yrs|90.9	|88.6	|83.4	|85.9	|84.4 |
| 35-39yrs|54.2	|52.7	|49.4	|52.8	|52.0 |

-   sometimes you'll find data where the columns and rows have been flipped 
-   that's slow to fix by hand, but luckily you can **transpose it**, which swaps rows and columns
-   select your data, and copy/paste into a new cell
-   then use the transpose option <br>![transpose option](images/clipboard-3580893754.png)
