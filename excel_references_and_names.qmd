## Welcome

- this session is aimed at Excel beginners
- it's social and practical, so **cameras on** please
- while we're waiting to start, you might like to:
  - join our Teams channel: **[tinyurl.com/kindnetwork](https://forms.office.com/r/WQdd6HSCEW)**
  - look at our training pages: **[tinyurl.com/kindtrp](https://nes-dew.github.io/KIND-training/)**
  - look at [the M365 Skills Hub](https://scottish.sharepoint.com/sites/NHSSLearningPathways)


## Session outline

![Beginner's Excel skill-tree](images/clipboard-4090026779.png)

- this is a beginners session about references and names in Excel
- this is social learning (cameras, contribute, calm)
- we'll run through the basics of references and names, and then move into a practical demo

## References

-   Excel sheets are made up of cells
-   cells are arranged in rows and columns
    -   columns have letters - like `C`
    -   rows have numbers - like `3`
-   references are the 'address' of a particular cell - like `C3`

## What do references do?

+ references identify cells: like an address
+ references let you use the value a cell contains
+ e.g. adding up columns, calculating averages, finding differences

::: {.notes}
show a practical example
:::

## Finding a reference

-   from the **name box**: </br> ![](images/clipboard-1746127255.png)
-   or work out from the column and row labels
    - always column letter, then row number
    - **C3**, not **3C**

## Using a reference

- we can write a formula that copies the value from C3 into another cell
- formulas start with an `=`
- so writing `= C3` copies the value from C3 into another cell

## References in formulas

-  we use references to allow us to pass data around our spreadsheet
-  that allows us to perform calculations on that data

::: {.notes}
 an example: how much did Emma's score improve during the session?
-  calculate this with `= C3 - C2`
:::


## References move
- by default, Excel references are **relative**
- when you move a reference, the cell that reference points to also moves </br> ![](images/clipboard-754991469.png){width="200"}
- it is possible to 'fix' references
    - we call these **absolute** references
    - the `$` fixes a reference, so `$C$3` is absolute
    
## Names
- it's possible to name cells by typing in the name box
- that's useful if you have a value you need to refer to several times: it's easier to remember what `max_score` means than `D44`

# Practical

## Some sample data

| user   | pre-training score  | post-training score  | session |
|--------|---------------------|----------------------|---------|
| Steve  | 4                   | 6                    | Excel 1 |
| Emma   | 7                   | 6                    | Excel 2 |
| Bhavin | 3                   | 9                    | Excel 1 |

## Using a reference

-   we can write a formula that copies the value from C3 into another cell

. . .

::: {.callout-tip appearance="default" icon="true"}

-   go to an empty cell, type `= C3`, and press `Enter/‚èé`
- that cell should now have Emma's visit date (or whatever value you referenced)
:::


## References in formulas

-   how much did people improve during the training session?

. . .

::: {.callout-tip appearance="default" icon="true"}
## Task

-   add a new column called `improvement`
-   in the first row of that column, add the formula: `= C2 - B2`
    -   that calculates the post-training score minus the pre-training score</br> ![](images/clipboard-2200716982.png){height="200"}
- then copy/fill down

:::

## References move

::: {.callout-tip appearance="default" icon="true"}
## Task
+ try copying your new block of `improvement` cells around your sheet
+ their value should change (almost certainly to a `#VALUE` error)
+ now try clicking those cells to see where the updated reference points to </br> ![](images/clipboard-754991469.png)
:::



## Absolute references
::: {.callout-tip appearance="default" icon="true"}
## Task
+ delete your copied blocks of cells from the last step
+ now update your references by adding `$` before the letter and number
    + so `C2` becomes `$C$2`
    + you might prefer to press `F4` instead
+ now copy and paste those blocks of cells again. What's different this time?
+ please delete those new blocks of cells when you're finished

:::


::: {.notes}

- almost everything in Excel can be named
- the easy way to start with that is using the **name box**
- names can replace references in formulas
- this is valuable when things get more complicated

- manage via the **Name manager** (`Ctrl` + `F3`)
- **Go to** (`F5`)
